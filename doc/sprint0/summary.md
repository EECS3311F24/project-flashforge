# Project Summary
**Summary:** FlashForge is an online flashcard website designed to help Computer Science and Software Engineering students study and prepare for exams. The platform aims to provide users with an easy, organized, and interactive way to learn and engage with course material through the use of flashcards. Users have the flexibility to choose from a library of pre-created flashcards or create personalized flashcards that cater to their specific course material and learning needs. By focusing on definitions, key concepts, and terminologies relevant to Computer Science and Software Engineering, FlashForge aims to be a go-to resource for academic review.

**Objective:** Build a flashcard website specifically for Computer Science and Software Engineering students, where students can find and create their own flashcards based on Software Engineering/CS course material. The objective is to make learning more engaging, interactive, and efficient, helping students achieve better academic grades.

**Key Persona:** Kevin, a 20-year-old CS major, is struggling to study for an upcoming software design midterm. Kevin finds it challenging to remember key terms and definitions, especially when reviewing large amounts of information. He wants to find an easy-to-use study tool that will help him reinforce his knowledge. FlashForge offers a solution specifically geared toward his needs, enabling him to focus on the areas where he requires the most practice through flashcards.

**Key Scenario:** Kevin has a midterm next week and needs to review important terms for his software design class. He uses the flashcards on FlashForge's website to prepare for the upcoming midterm.

**Key Principle:** Ease of use and a user-friendly design. The website should provide an efficient and enjoyable experience with minimal distractions.

# Process
- **How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?**
We organized the team with Discord meetings and standups. Some tools we use are Discord to organize conferences and divide tasks among group members and Google Docs to write functions that need to be accomplished and by when. 
   
- **How did you make decisions?**
We made decisions by choice. Each group member chose which portion/task they wanted to complete during a meeting and we decided on a date to finish those tasks.

- **How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?**
We assigned one member of the group the user stories and reviewed them after completion to revise priority and points. Instead of voting, we had a general discussion to come to a consensus for the point estimate

- **How frequently did you meet?**
Our group meets once to twice a week depending on the tasks and due dates ahead. We usually meet on Discord to see how everyone progresses and what tasks are left to be accomplished.

- **What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?**
We need to take more detailed notes at our meetings and provide a better schedule on when certain tasks need to be done along with following the waterfall method for the coding portion.

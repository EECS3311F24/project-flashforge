## User Stories

### Creating a deck
1. “As a software engineering student, I want to make sure my knowledge of every topic for EECS 3311 is as refined as possible. I'd love to create a personalized deck that allows me to review my weakest points of study.”

### Professor developed question board
2. “As a professor, I understand my students may be overwhelmed by the topics covered in my EECS 3215 class, as such I have created a deck with general topics that will be covered on the final exam. Because I want the students to learn by themselves, I did not include answers on the backside of any flashcards, that is for them to copy and customize.”

### Using the shuffle deck feature
3. “As a well-versed computer science student I’ve already memorized the answers to each flashcard in order, shuffling the deck would allow me to see if I have a real understanding of each topic or I’ve just memorized the answers by order”

### Handiness of pre-existing decks with solutions
4. “As a software engineering student, I’ve always needed a quick way to use the active recall studying technique. Using paper flashcards has been handy but having something digital where I don’t need to write down the questions and answers would be really helpful to make this process more impactful and less time consuming.”

5. “As a software engineering student it is very hard to tell if I am asking myself the right questions while studying. When I do ask myself questions, I also always have trouble paraphrasing logical definitions for me to better understand the content. A way to study frequent and important topics through good questions with the addition of straight to the point answers is something I really desire.”

6. “As a CS student studying for my final, scouring the internet for sample finals is difficult at times, questions and answers being separate or no solution being provided at all is a common problem. Because of this I would love a centralized site for studying important contents of specific CS courses with answers attached”

### Flipping through flash cards
7. “As a student, studying has been a challenge for me but I have found that flashcards are the most effective method for my success. I’d love to be able to flip flash cards and move to the next one with a simple click instead of having to shuffle a deck of real cards”

### Completing a timed trial
8. “EECS final exams always turn out well when there is enough time to review your work after completion. As a computer science major I prioritize getting to this stage so that I can double check my answers prior to handing anything in, I practice this by going through paper flashcards and timing it with my phone. I want my practice times to be a lot more precise and juggling a timer plus flipping through paper flashcards can skew the results. For this reason, I want a method to time my ability to answer flashcard length questions digitally.”

### Peer-to-peer mode
9. “My friend and I live 2 hours apart from each other but take the same EECS 3421 class. We’d love to study together and ask review questions quickly and efficiently without knowing what the questions might be so we would love to use some sort of digital flash card to ask each other these questions without being shown the answers beforehand.”

### Filter & search bar
10. “As an IT-Streamed CS student, I have very particular questions related to courses not commonly taken by most CS/Software Eng  majors. Because of this I’d love a flash card website with a great filter & search system that allows me to find exactly what I need”

### Set user courses in settings, recommended decks will follow user settings
11. “As a CS student in my third year, I am taking 4 CS courses because of my good grades over the years. I love studying with flashcards but creating multiple decks for 4 CS courses is challenging and time consuming. A flash card website which allows me to prioritize seeing decks from specific courses would be very useful to make this process easier.”

### Completing a timed quiz
12. “As a computer science student I've always struggled with time management on my exams. I would love a way to practice the most common topics of EECS 3311 under time constraints without creating the questions so I can have an understanding of through unexpected questions”

### Change flashcard quiz formatting
13. “As a CS student preparing for an OOP final, I have a lot of definitions and java syntax to remember. My class was informed by the professor that there would be some multiple choice questions and I really want to practice this formatting. As such, a method of self testing through this desired format would be very helpful to simulate the real test environment.”

### Mix & Match game
14. “Using flashcards is not always fun for me, it can get tedious especially with more complex courses where concepts are lengthy. The process of using the same cards repeatedly or making new decks can also be very boring. As a Software Engineering student I need some entertainment even while studying, a mix-and-match game mode to test knowledge for any desired course would satisfy that.”

### Study Group 
15. “I always study with my friends and classmates as a CS major but sharing notes and testing each other can be relatively hard because of how large the group is, especially sharing short-form notes through pictures if these notes are handwritten. As such a method of sharing created short notes (decks) where each of us could add and remove pre-created or newly created notes would be wonderful.”

### Study tips page
16. “As a first year Software Engineering major, I’ve been struggling to find a suitable method to study effectively. Digital flashcards have helped me the most yet I feel like I’m not using them as effectively as I could be. I’d like the ability to see a consistently updated forum with tips on how to use flashcards and to study for specific classes.

### Study Buddy
17. “It can be hard keeping up with classmates after lectures end, as a CS major with a job right after class I don’t have much time for long interactions related to the course or otherwise. This results in me studying individually a lot more than I’d like to. Flashcards help me during the process but a way to study with a classmate even in a potentially different section on my computer would be very beneficial. It’d be even more helpful if we do not need to time each others study sessions by just dropping flashcards and notes onto a simple paired folder to make the process more asynchronous”

### Deck Mix Mode
18. “As a CS major I am overwhelmed with final exams all around the same time period and switching back and forth between subjects has been difficult to manage, especially whilst using flash cards. Keeping every deck organized during this stressful period has become challenging . I’d love a way to streamline my study experience in a way where all courses could be practiced simultaneously via a quiz containing all course questions and answers shuffled together. This would help me make sure I understand these courses for the better and have the ability to differentiate where the knowledge is coming from.”

### Share feature(Study Tips)
19. “As a Software Engineering student in my last year of study, I’d hate for lower year students to experience the obstacles I had to juggle when starting out my degree. My studying methods have changed drastically and I’d love a way to share dos and don’ts online where every CS/Soft Eng major could find and read it without issue.”

### Share feature (Flashcards)
20. “Writing lengthy study notes is something I do to engrain course content into my memory. The formatting and length of my notes make them difficult to share with my peers, and as a CS major collaborative studying works very well for understanding material. I have found sharing small flash card paper notes to be easier but a way to create them digitally, download an organized PDF or send a viewing link to my peers would make the whole process much more efficient.”
